- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @william-h-oliver and I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [AstroAI-Lab](https://astroai-lab.de/) at Heidelberg University.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making sense of the formation and evolution of structure within our Universe and what studying this can tell us about the underlying physics.
- ðŸŒ± Naturally Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything involving structure classification! Particularly within the fields of galactic archaeology, large-scale structure of the Universe, gaseous filaments in the Milky Way, etc, in both simulated and observational settings. I'm also excited by anything 'quantitative machine learning' including PINNs, metric learning, (multi-modal) representation learning, and more!
- ðŸ“« Feel free to get in contact with me via email: [william.oliver@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de](mailto:william.oliver@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de) or [william.hardie.oliver@gmail.com](mailto:william.hardie.oliver@gmail.com)
