- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @william-h-oliver and I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [AstroAI-Lab](https://astroai-lab.de/) at Heidelberg University.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making sense of the formation and evolution of structure within our Universe and what studying this can tell us about the underlying physics.
- ðŸŒ± Naturally Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything involving structure classification! Particularly within the fields of galactic archaeology, large-scale structure of the Universe, gaseous filaments in the Milky Way, etc, in both simulated and observational settings. But also in much broader topics such as social structure and human-genome structure.
- ðŸ“« Feel free to get in contact with me via my email: [william.oliver@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de](mailto:william.oliver@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de) or [william.hardie.oliver@gmail.com](mailto:william.hardie.oliver@gmail.com)
