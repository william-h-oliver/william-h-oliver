# üëã Hi, I'm William H. Oliver

I'm a postdoctoral researcher working at the intersection of **astrophysics** and **machine learning**, focusing on how complex structures emerge and evolve in the Universe.  
My research centers on **hierarchical clustering**, **metric learning**, and **diffeomorphic transformations** for modeling structure in high-dimensional astrophysical data.

I'm broadly interested in:
- Machine learning methods for **structure formation**, **representation learning**, and **uncertainty modeling**  
- Developing open-source tools that make **scientific ML** more interpretable and reproducible  
- Cross-disciplinary applications of clustering and flow-based modeling

## üöÄ Featured Projects

| Project | Description |
|---|---|
| **[AstroLink](https://github.com/william-h-oliver/astrolink)** | A hierarchical clustering algorithm built for large astrophysical datasets. Provides robust and interpretable structure with minimal parameter tuning. |
| **[FuzzyCat](https://github.com/william-h-oliver/fuzzycat)** | An unsupervised and data-blind algorithm built to account for the effects of *change-processes* on clusters. Useful for propagating uncertainties, constructing time-invariant labels, and abstracting over model choices. |
| **[Fishereyes](https://github.com/william-h-oliver/fishereyes)** | A JAX-based framework for uncertainty-aware representation learning of heteroskedastic data. Provides a multi-dimensional precision-weighted embedding of the data into Euclidean space where measuring distances is easy. |
