# üëã Hi, I'm William H. Oliver

I'm a postdoctoral researcher working at the intersection of **astrophysics** and **machine learning**, focusing on how complex structures emerge and evolve in the Universe.  
My research centers on **hierarchical clustering**, **metric learning**, and **diffeomorphic transformations** for modeling structure in high-dimensional astrophysical data.

I'm broadly interested in:
- Machine learning methods for **structure formation**, **representation learning**, and **uncertainty modeling**  
- Developing open-source tools that make **scientific ML** more interpretable and reproducible  
- Cross-disciplinary applications of clustering and flow-based modeling

## üöÄ Featured Projects

| Project | Description |
|---|---|
| **[AstroLink](https://github.com/william-h-oliver/astrolink)** | A hierarchical clustering algorithm for astrophysical datasets. Provides stable, interpretable structure trees with minimal tuning. |
| **[FuzzyCat](https://github.com/william-h-oliver/fuzzycat)** | A toolkit for fuzzy cluster propagation and ensemble consensus, useful for quantifying uncertainty in hierarchical classifications. |
| **[Fishereyes](https://github.com/william-h-oliver/fishereyes)** | A JAX-based framework for learning diffeomorphic transformations of heteroskedastic data ‚Äî aligning local covariances to the identity for uncertainty-aware representation learning. |
